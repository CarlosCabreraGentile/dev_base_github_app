### Github App
Write a simple web application using ReactJS. You may use React seed projects to bootstrap your application. You do not have to build the user interface identically, the look will depend on which UI libraries you use if any (Bootstrap, etc.).

Here is a YouTube video of the complete web application.


Application Data
The application should use GitHub public API to get information about GitHub users.

You will retrieve information for a specific user by sending a GET request to: https://api.github.com/users/{{ user's GitHub name }}

Follow the documentation https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users#get-a-user for more details.


Requirements
1. The application must have two screens, Home and Person (Mockups provided below).

Home screen should only list the Top 5 GitHub usernames: "GrahamCampbell","fabpot","weierophinney","rkh","josh".
Person screen should show full name, avatar, and location for a given username.
2. The application must be mobile responsive.

3. You should not work more than 90 minutes on this assessment.

4. Your code must be bug-free.



The candidate will be evaluated for:
Completion of the functionality.
Accuracy of the design (UI/UX). Although you don't have to build an exact similar interface as presented on the mockups, we expect a modern, user-friendly and responsive UI.
Code structure and strategy used.
Code cleanliness.


Mockups:

Home - Web
Person - Web
Home - Mobile
Person - Mobile 
You may use those Figma designs to get any colors, measurements, padding, etc.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
